# Prelim Review Activity

## ðŸ“š Overview
This repository contains our groupâ€™s submission for the Prelim Review Activity.  
We demonstrated the following programming concepts using *Python* and *JavaScript*:

- Syntax vs Semantic Error  
- Token Examples (keywords, identifiers, literals)  
- Variable Scope (global vs local)  
- Strong vs Weak Typing  

Each member contributed either code or reflection to complete the activity, following the Git commit requirement.

## âœ¨ Reflections

### Angela (Python) 
* *What concept was most challenging in the activity?*

The most challenging part for me was *strong vs weak typing*. At first, I thought it worked like syntax or semantic errors, but I realized it depends on the programming language itself. Through this activity, I finally understood the difference: Python enforces strict typing, while other languages like JavaScript can behave differently.  

Another challenge was using Git since Iâ€™m still new. I had to learn commands like git add . and git push, and I even double-checked on GitHub browser to make sure everything uploaded. It was a good review for Python, and I felt more confident that I still remember the basics.  

* *What tools did you use to complete the exercise?*

The tools I used to complete this exercise are VS Code, Git, GitHub, Google, and Gemini. I used the GitHub browser to double-check if my files were properly uploaded. Whenever I encountered problems, I used Google and Gemini to quickly find specific solutions, especially when I made mistakes with Git commands. I used VS code to run the python program and to execute my Git commands.

### Adam (JavaScript/C++)  
* What concept was most challenging in the activity?

Despite the main challenge for me is understanding the new programming languages that I'm not familiarize with, the other challenging aspect within this activity is utilizing what is a token for each new keywords, literals, and string within the C++.

* What tools did you use to complete the exercise?

I've utilized VS Code, GIt, Github, W3Schools, and Youtube. I utilized vs code for making the code and its compiler. Github was used for uploading our code in the repository. w3 schools for understanding the programming languages, along with youtube

### Mickz (README & Git consolidation)  
* *What concept was most challenging in the activity?*

My role was to help consolidate our outputs into one repository and prepare the README. The challenge for me was making sure all commits from each member were properly pushed and documented, since part of the grading involves Git activity and commit history. I also had to make sure the README connects to the code snippets without repeating them.
