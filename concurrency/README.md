# ðŸ“¦ Concurrency Models Activity

## ðŸ“š Overview
This repository contains our groupâ€™s submission for the **Concurrency Models Activity**. The primary **objective** was:
> "To analyze and demonstrate concurrency models using a programming language of choice."

We implemented and explored the following concepts in **Python** and **C++** (as per the group's current work):

- **Concurrency:** Running multiple tasks seemingly at the same time.
- **Parallel Tasks:** Implementing at least two tasks (functions) to execute concurrently.

The code is located in the `/concurrency/` folder. Each member contributed code or a reflection to meet the activity requirements, including the mandatory **incremental Git commit** structure.
