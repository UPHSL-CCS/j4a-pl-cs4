# Control Flow Activity

## ðŸ“š Overview
This repository contains our groupâ€™s submission for the Control Flow Activity. The **objective** was:
> "To explore and compare control flow constructs and expressions across programming languages."

We implemented and explored the following concepts in **[Language 1, e.g., Python]** and **[Language 2, e.g., Java]**:

- `if-else` statements
- Looping constructs (`for` and `while` loops)
- Arithmetic and logical expressions

Each member contributed code or a reflection to meet the activity requirements, including the mandatory Git commit for at least one construct.

## ðŸ’» Code Snippet Summary

| Concept | [Language 1, e.g., Python] | [Language 2, e.g., Java] |
|:--------------------------|:------------------------------|:---------------------------|
| `if-else` Statement | âœ”  | âœ”  |
| `for` Loop | âœ” | âœ”  |
| `while` Loop | âœ”  | âœ”  |
| Arithmetic & Logical Expr. | âœ”  | âœ”  |

All code snippets can be found inside the `/control-flow/` folder.

## âœ¨ Reflections

### Angela (Python)

* *What concept was most challenging in the activity?*

The hardest part for me was making sure the program works even when the user types something wrong. I had to learn how to use try-except so the program doesnâ€™t crash. It was also a bit tricky to make the loop keep going until the user guessed the right number.

* *Enumerate the differences in how each language handles control flow.*

In Python, we use spaces (indentation) to show what is inside if, elif, else, and loops. The program runs step by step following the conditions. Loops like while repeat until the condition is false. Python also lets us catch errors with try-except, which helps control the flow when users give wrong input.

* *What tools did you use to complete the exercise?*
I used VS Code to write the code and ran it in the terminal. I also looked online for examples on try-except and Python loops.

### Adam (C++)


* *What concept was most challenging in the activity?*

  The hardest part in this activity was understanding c++ random number generator we picked, to the point of using ai to answer and modify my code. Tho if-else and while are familiar to since it's somewhat the same logic as python


* *Enumerate the differences in how each language handles control flow.*

In c++, it dictates the order in which statements in a program are executed, enabling decision-making, repetition of tasks, and handling of different program paths. If follows a specified condition is true, else-if checks the 1st condition is false and the 2nd is true, and else if all the conditions are false. While also checks a block of code if the condition is true

* *What tools did you use to complete the exercise?*
  The tools I used is gemini, w3schools, and vscode to do this work
