# Control Flow Activity

## ðŸ“š Overview
This repository contains our groupâ€™s submission for the Control Flow Activity. The **objective** was:
> "To explore and compare control flow constructs and expressions across programming languages."

We implemented and explored the following concepts in **[Language 1, e.g., Python]** and **[Language 2, e.g., Java]**:

- `if-else` statements
- Looping constructs (`for` and `while` loops)
- Arithmetic and logical expressions

Each member contributed code or a reflection to meet the activity requirements, including the mandatory Git commit for at least one construct.

## ðŸ’» Code Snippet Summary

| Concept | [Language 1, e.g., Python] | [Language 2, e.g., Java] |
|:--------------------------|:------------------------------|:---------------------------|
| `if-else` Statement | âœ” (by [Member Name]) | âœ” (by [Member Name]) |
| `for` Loop | âœ” (by [Member Name]) | âœ” (by [Member Name]) |
| `while` Loop | âœ” (by [Member Name]) | âœ” (by [Member Name]) |
| Arithmetic & Logical Expr. | âœ” (by [Member Name]) | âœ” (by [Member Name]) |

All code snippets can be found inside the `/control-flow/` folder.
